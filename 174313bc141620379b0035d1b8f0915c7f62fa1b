      "message": "Pending upstream review and merge.\n\nOne thing we need to figure out here is.\n* If we don\u0027t bump version code, we can\u0027t release this as a separate update, but we can ship it with the OS update\n* Bumping version code would cause conflicts with upstream every single merge, but in some ways it\u0027s a necessity to be able to ship things.\n\nFor microG what we\u0027re doing is adding the commits on top of upstream tag to the version code - so this\u0027d end up being +2 or +3 or something which would ensure that it gets bumped every time, and also avoid conflicts since it would be a one-time change to build.gradle",
