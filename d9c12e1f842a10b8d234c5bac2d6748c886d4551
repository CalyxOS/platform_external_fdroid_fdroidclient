      "message": "Thoughts?\n\nThis wouldn\u0027t make sense upstream, but I noticed this in the latest update where we shipped Organic Maps.\n\nFor existing users that app doesn\u0027t get installed, so if they go to F-Droid it\u0027d download the APK again while it was just there sitting on the device in the local repo.\n\nThis was also before Organic Maps got updated on F-Droid, it was the exact same version when we shipped yesterday. That may happen for some apps but not all.\n\n\nThis is a small change wrt upstream to avoid conflicts, otherwise perhaps we could just let the XML specify priority, but that\u0027s not needed / would be overkill.",
